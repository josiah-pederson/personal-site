Every day, I do both as a Software Engineer, Immersive Resident for the Galvanize, Inc. 19-week Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive. After completing the program, I am mentoring new students and helping them develop an understanding of concepts ranging from Django, React, and SQL to data structures and algorithms. In my time in the program and beyond, I have already gotten to work on five full-stack microservice-based applications incorporating skills and technologies including JavaScript, Django, React, Redux, Docker, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DDD, RESTful APIs, CI/CD, RabbitMQ, HTML, CSS, Heroku, Microservices, Monoliths, and, of course (my favorite), Python!\n\nBefore getting into software engineering, I built my interpersonal communication and problem-solving skills as a Technical Expert at an Apple store Genius Bar for over two-and-a-half years. During the same time, I worked for a nonprofit in which regular trips to China were part of the role. I learned to be comfortable being uncomfortable while learning a language immersed in a very different culture than my own. With my interest in the tech industry growing, I enrolled in the Hack Reactor program and have had great success in that thus far with a 99.75% average project and exam score.\n\nThese experiences and more have aided me in building a strong foundation for professional development in the web development industry. They have helped me better recognize my love of learning and problem-solving. These experiences have shown me that I can work hard and want to do that alongside an engineering team to build websites that give visitors a seamless and memorable experience.\n\n# I like\n\n- Fitness\n- Frigid Chicago winters\n- Linguistic studies (Mandarin, German)\n- Mountains > Beaches but I am not opposed to having both\n- 20th century history (WWI, WWII, Cold War)\n- Composing orchestral music\n- Listening to Opera: Der Ring des Nibelungen is my favorite\n- International travel!\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I spent the first 5 years of my life in South Korea, North Korea (briefly), Philippines, China, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Great times with the exception of regularly getting sick.\n- In high school, I spent a few weeks in the slums of India. I'll never forget what I saw there.\n- In the summer of 2014, I spent the summer as a video production intern in Poland. That was pretty neat. I was also given the opportunity to backpack and camp in the Swiss and French Alps, visit Berlin, and spend some time in London.\n- The next summer, I spent the time learning Chinese in Tianjin. Great time.\n- From November - December of 2019, I got to revisit a variety of cities in China. Interestingly, the last one was Wuhan mere weeks before the lockdowns began.\n- At the end of 2021, I took an unforgettable trip to [Egypt] (https://youtu.be/jw5NMPWivjc).\n- In the fall, I will return to Vietnam and Thailand to visit a K-12 school I helped start several years ago.\n- Next summer, I plan to go to Italy and Austria for an operatic tour.\n",d=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,(0,a.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Josiah Pederson",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(o(),{source:h,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);

Having graduated from the program myself, I mentor new students and help them develop an understanding of concepts ranging from Django, React, and SQL to data structures and algorithms.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter graduating from Wheaton College with a degree in Communication, I founded a media marketing freelance business corresponding with clients including universities, small businesses, and municipalities. With a growing interest in tech, I continued building my interpersonal communication and problem-solving skills as a Technical Expert at the Apple Genius Bar over a two-and-a-half-year period. During that time, I completed several JavaScript programming courses and found the material exhilarating. In the first half of 2022, I enrolled in Hack Reactor\u2019s Software Engineering Immersive and graduated with perfect scores on all examinations and a job offer to support other boot camp cohorts as a Software Engineer, Immersive Resident.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThese experiences have reinforced my passion for learning and built a strong platform for professional development in the Software Engineering industry. As I explore new web development opportunities I look forward to working alongside an engineering team with a love of learning, collaboration, and building sites that offer a seamless and memorable user experience.\n\n# I like\n\n- Fitness\n- Composing orchestral music\n- Frigid Chicago winters\n- Video games\n- 20th century history (WWI, WWII, Cold War)\n- Mountains > beaches but I am not opposed to having both\n- Logic puzzles\n- Linguistic studies (Mandarin Chinese, German)\n- Listening to Opera: [Der Ring des Nibelungen](https://music.apple.com/us/album/wagner-der-ring-des-nibelungen/1440775500) sind meine Lieblingsopern\n- International travel!\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\nPhotos from my travels [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Q1XL2w69a4iJ41SR8)!\n\n- I spent the first 5 years of my life in South Korea, North Korea (briefly), Philippines, China, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Great times with the exception of regularly getting sick.\n- In high school, I spent a few weeks in the slums of India. I'll never forget the level of poverty I witnessed there.\n- In the summer of 2014, I was a video production intern in Krakow, Poland. Visiting Auschwitz was a sobering experience. I was also given the opportunity to backpack and camp in the Swiss and French Alps, visit Berlin, and explore London.\n- The next summer, I spent the time learning Chinese in Tianjin. Great time.\n- From November - December of 2019, I got to revisit a variety of cities in China. Interestingly, the last one was Wuhan mere days before the lockdowns began.\n- A month living on the north side of Kauai in 2021 convinced me that Hawaii is one of the most breathtaking places on earth.

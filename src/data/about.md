# A bit about me

Two things I love: solving problems and actively learning (preferably alongside others). Every day, I do both as a Software Engineer, Immersive Resident for the Galvanize, Inc. 19-week Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive. Having completed the program myself, I am mentoring new students and helping them develop an understanding of concepts ranging from Django, React, and SQL to data structures and algorithms.

I have am proficient with Python, JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS and have experience working with PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Django, FastAPI, RabbitMQ, and SimpleJWT. I have also worked on both Microservices and Monolith services, using test-driven and domain-driven design.

Before getting into software engineering, I built my interpersonal communication and problem-solving skills as a Technical Expert at an Apple store Genius Bar for over two-and-a-half years. During the same time, I worked for a nonprofit in which regular trips to China were part of the role. I learned to be comfortable being uncomfortable while learning a language immersed in a very different culture than my own. With my interest in the tech industry growing, I enrolled in the Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive program and graduated with perfect scores on all examinations and an offer to mentor other boot camp students as a Software Engineer, Immersive Resident. These experiences and more aided me in building a strong foundation for professional development in the web development industry.

# Travel / Geography

- I spent the first 5 years of my life in South Korea, North Korea (briefly), Philippines, China, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Great times with the exception of regularly getting sick.
- In high school, I spent a few weeks in the slums of India. I'll never forget what I saw there.
- In the summer of 2014, I spent the summer as a video production intern in Poland. That was pretty neat. I was also given the opportunity to backpack and camp in the Swiss and French Alps, visit Berlin, and spend some time in London.
- The next summer, I spent the time learning Chinese in Tianjin. Great time.
- From November - December of 2019, I got to revisit a variety of cities in China. Interestingly, the last one was Wuhan mere weeks before the lockdowns began.
- At the end of 2021, I took an unforgettable trip to [Egypt](https://youtu.be/jw5NMPWivjc).
- In the fall, I will return to Vietnam and Thailand to visit a K-12 school I helped start several years ago.
- Next summer, I plan to go to Italy and Austria for an operatic tour.

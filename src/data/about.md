# A bit about me

When people ask me, ‘what are you passionate about?’, my response is, ‘learning and using that knowledge to solve problems that make someone or something better.’ Every day, I do exactly that as a Software Engineer, Immersive Resident for Galvanize’s 19-week Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive. Having graduated from the program myself, I mentor new students and help them develop an understanding of concepts ranging from Django, React, and SQL to data structures and algorithms.

After graduating from Wheaton College with a degree in Communication, I founded a media marketing freelance business corresponding with clients including universities, small businesses, and municipalities. With a growing interest in tech, I continued building my interpersonal communication and problem-solving skills as a Technical Expert at the Apple Genius Bar over a two-and-a-half-year period. During that time, I completed several JavaScript programming courses and found the material exhilarating. In the first half of 2022, I enrolled in Hack Reactor’s Software Engineering Immersive and graduated with perfect scores on all examinations and a job offer to support other boot camp cohorts as a Software Engineer, Immersive Resident.

These experiences have reinforced my passion for learning and built a strong platform for professional development in the Software Engineering industry. As I explore new web development opportunities I look forward to working alongside an engineering team with a love of learning, collaboration, and building sites that offer a seamless and memorable user experience.

My [projects](/projects) currently include four full-stack microservice-based applications incorporating skills and technologies including JavaScript, Django, React, Redux, Docker, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DDD, RESTful APIs, CI/CD, RabbitMQ, HTML, CSS, Heroku, Microservices, Monoliths, and, (my favorite), Python!

# Travel / Geography

- I spent the first 5 years of my life in South Korea, North Korea (briefly), Philippines, China, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Great times with the exception of regularly getting sick.
- In high school, I spent a few weeks in the slums of India. I'll never forget what I saw there.
- In the summer of 2014, I spent the summer as a video production intern in Poland. That was pretty neat. I was also given the opportunity to backpack and camp in the Swiss and French Alps, visit Berlin, and spend some time in London.
- The next summer, I spent the time learning Chinese in Tianjin. Great time.
- From November - December of 2019, I got to revisit a variety of cities in China. Interestingly, the last one was Wuhan mere weeks before the lockdowns began.
- At the end of 2021, I took an unforgettable trip to [Egypt](https://youtu.be/jw5NMPWivjc).
- In the fall, I will return to Vietnam and Thailand to visit a K-12 school I helped start several years ago.
- Next summer, I plan to go to Italy and Austria for an operatic tour.

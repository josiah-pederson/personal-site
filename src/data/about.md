# A bit about me

Two things I love: solving problems and actively learning (preferably alongside others). Every day, I do both as a full-time full-stack web development student in the 19-week Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive. (This next sentence will fail the one-breath sentence test. In the interest of keeping readers awake, I advise skipping to paragraph two if you're not a Software Engineer or Recruiter.) I have already gotten to work on five full-stack microservice-based applications incorporating skills and technologies including JavaScript, Django, React, Redux, Docker, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DDD, RESTful APIs, CI/CD, RabbitMQ, HTML, CSS, Heroku, Microservices, Monoliths, and, of course (my favorite) Python and I don't graduate until mid-August!

Before getting into software engineering, I built my interpersonal communication and problem-solving skills as a Technical Expert at an Apple store Genius Bar for over two-and-a-half years. During the same time, I worked for a nonprofit in which regular trips to China were part of the role. I learned to be comfortable being uncomfortable while learning a language immersed in a very different culture than my own. With my interest in the tech industry growing, I enrolled in the Hack Reactor program and have had great success in that thus far with a 99.75% average project and exam score.

These experiences and more have aided me in building a strong foundation for professional development in the web development industry. They have helped me better recognize my love of learning and problem-solving. These experiences have shown me that I can work hard and want to do that alongside an engineering team to build websites that give visitors a seamless and memorable experience.

# I like

- Fitness
- Brutal Winters
- Linguistic studies (Mandarin, German)
- Mountains > Beaches but I am not opposed to having both
- 20th century history (WWI, WWII, Cold War)
- Composing orchestral music
- Listening to Opera: Der Ring des Nibelungen is one of my favorites
- International travel!

# Travel / Geography

- I spent the first 5 years of my life in South Korea, North Korea (briefly), Philippines, China, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Great times with the exception of regularly getting sick.
- In high school, I spent a few weeks in the slums of India. I'll never forget what I saw there.
- In the summer of 2014, I spent the summer as a video production intern in Poland. That was pretty neat. I was also given the opportunity to backpack and camp in the Swiss and French Alps, visit Berlin, and spend some time in London.
- The next summer, I spent the time learning Chinese in Tianjin. Great time.
- In November - December of 2019, I got to revisit a variety of cities in China. Interestingly, the last one was Wuhan mere weeks before the lockdowns began.
- At the end of 2021, I took a trip to [Egypt] (https://youtu.be/jw5NMPWivjc) which was unforgettable.
- In the fall, I will return to Vietnam and Thailand to visit a school I helped start several years ago.
- Next summer, I plan to go to Italy and Austria for an operatic tour.

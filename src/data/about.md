# Intro

Two things I love: solving problems and learning (preferably alongside others). Every day, I do both as a full-time full-stack web development student in the 19-week Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive. (This next sentence will fail the one-breath sentence test.) I have already gotten to work on five full-stack microservice-based applications incorporating skills and technologies including JavaScript, Django, React, Redux, Docker, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DDD, RESTful APIs, RabbitMQ, HTML, CSS, Heroku, Microservices, Monoliths, and, of course (my favorite) Python and I don't graduate until mid-August!

# My winding history

- Christopher Nolan, Steven Spielberg, Alfred Hitchcock were amongst some of my high school heroes. I wanted to be a film director. 
- I studied Media Communication in college and learned that the film industry was not what I wanted to get involved in. Being a film enthusiast was enough for me. (oh, and by studied, I mean did literally anything except study...)
- Post-college: I dabbled in freelance videography while looking for a vocation more to my tastes. An acquaintance and I started a media production business but that was a couple months before COVID (IDK if you've heard of it, it was a big deal)
- I worked at an Apple Store as a repair technician for a couple years. That was fun for the first few months, but retail and I were never meant to end up together.
- At that same time, I started work at a non-profit involving education in China. An amazing experience, but also not a long term fit for me.
- I'd been told by several friends and family members that I am a bit of a nerd and should at least look into Computer Science. I did look into it. One thing led to another and here I am and I couldn't be happier.

# I like

# Travel / Geography

- I spent the first 5 years of my life in South Korea, North Korea (briefly), Philippines, China, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Great times with the exception of regularly getting sick.
- In high school, I spent a few weeks in the slums of India. I'll never forget what I saw there.
- In the summer of 2014, I spent the summer as a video production intern in Poland. That was pretty neat. I was also given the opportunity to backpack and camp in the Swiss and French Alps, visit Berlin, and spend some time in London.
- The next summer, I spent the time learning Chinese in Tianjin. Great time.
- In November - December of 2019, I got to revisit a variety of cities in China. Interestingly, the last one was Wuhan mere weeks before the lockdowns began.
- At the end of 2021, I took a trip to [Egypt] (https://youtu.be/jw5NMPWivjc) which was unforgettable.
- In the fall, I will return to Vietnam and Thailand to visit a school I helped start several years ago.
- Next summer, I plan to go to Italy and Austria for an operatic tour.

Having graduated from the program myself, I mentor new students and help them develop an understanding of concepts ranging from Django, React, and SQL to data structures and algorithms.\n<br/>\nAfter graduating from Wheaton College with a degree in Communication, I founded a media marketing freelance business corresponding with clients including universities, small businesses, and municipalities. With a growing interest in tech, I continued building my interpersonal communication and problem-solving skills as a Technical Expert at the Apple Genius Bar over a two-and-a-half-year period. During that time, I completed several JavaScript programming courses and found the material exhilarating. In the first half of 2022, I enrolled in Hack Reactor\u2019s Software Engineering Immersive and graduated with perfect scores on all examinations and a job offer to support other boot camp cohorts as a Software Engineer, Immersive Resident.\n<br/>\nThese experiences have reinforced my passion for learning and built a strong platform for professional development in the Software Engineering industry. As I explore new web development opportunities I look forward to working alongside an engineering team with a love of learning, collaboration, and building sites that offer a seamless and memorable user experience.\n<br/>\nMy [projects](/projects) currently include four full-stack microservice-based applications incorporating skills and technologies including JavaScript, Django, React, Redux, Docker, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DDD, RESTful APIs, CI/CD, RabbitMQ, HTML, CSS, Heroku, Microservices, Monoliths, and, (my favorite), Python!\n\n# I like\n\n- Strength training\n- Frigid Chicago winters\n- Composing orchestral music\n- Video games\n- Logic puzzles\n- Mountains > beaches but I am not opposed to having both\n- 20th century history (WWI, WWII, Cold War)\n- Linguistic studies (Mandarin, German)\n- Listening to Opera: Der Ring des Nibelungen is meine Lieblingsoper\n- International travel!\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I spent the first 5 years of my life in South Korea, North Korea (briefly), Philippines, China, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Great times with the exception of regularly getting sick.\n- In high school, I spent a few weeks in the slums of India. I'll never forget what I saw there.\n- In the summer of 2014, I spent the summer as a video production intern in Poland. That was pretty neat. I was also given the opportunity to backpack and camp in the Swiss and French Alps, visit Berlin, and spend some time in London.\n- The next summer, I spent the time learning Chinese in Tianjin. Great time.\n- From November - December of 2019, I got to revisit a variety of cities in China. Interestingly, the last one was Wuhan mere weeks before the lockdowns began.\n- At the end of 2021, I took an unforgettable trip to [Egypt](https://youtu.be/jw5NMPWivjc).\n- In the fall, I will return to Vietnam and Thailand to visit a K-12 school I helped start several years ago.\n- Next summer, I plan to go to Italy and Austria for an operatic tour.\n",c=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,(0,a.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Josiah Pederson",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",c," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(o(),{source:d,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
